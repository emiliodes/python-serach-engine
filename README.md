# python-serach-engine
I built a Web Search Engine, Image Search Engine, and Reverse Image Search Engine using Python, Flask, and TensorFlow. It features web crawling, indexing, PageRank-based ranking, and AI-driven image search. The reverse image search leverages Deep Learning to find similar images.
